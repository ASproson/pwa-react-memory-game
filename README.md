# Progressive Web App: React Memory Game

I wanted to explore making a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app) using React and thought a memory game would be a good fit for that! 

The player has to match the coding language cards and each time they do their win is counted and displayed. At any point the user can reset the game back to 0 for a new player

The user can play the game in the browser [here](https://pwa-react-memory-game.web.app/) or download it to their device to play offline by clicking the Install/Download button in their browser navigation:

Once the game is installed on their device it works like a native app:

Because the app is now running natively on the device, whenever the users wins we can update the badge on the app similar to sending a notification to the user. Additionally, because the app is  installed natively, it now appears in the Windows application search:
